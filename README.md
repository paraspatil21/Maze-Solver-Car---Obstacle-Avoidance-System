Maze Solver Car - Obstacle-Avoidance System
A robotics project designed to navigate through mazes and avoid obstacles autonomously using ultrasonic sensors and motor control. This system uses multiple sensors to detect obstacles and decide the optimal path for navigation in real-time.

Features
Obstacle Avoidance: Detects and avoids obstacles dynamically using three ultrasonic sensors.
Autonomous Navigation: Navigates through mazes or predefined tracks without human intervention.
Real-Time Decision Making: Implements logic to choose the optimal direction (left, right, or forward).
Debugging Support: Outputs sensor data to the Serial Monitor for easy troubleshooting.
Flexible Thresholds: Adjustable distance threshold for obstacle detection to suit various environments.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: C++ (Arduino IDE)
Hardware Components:
Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
Motor Driver Module (L298N or similar)
DC Motors
Arduino Microcontroller
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Hardware Setup:

Arduino-compatible microcontroller
3 ultrasonic sensors (front, left, right)
Motor driver module
2 DC motors
Power source
Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE
NewPing Library
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-solver-car.git
Installation
Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for NewPing and click Install.
Upload the Code
Connect your Arduino to your computer.
Open the maze-solver.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Select the correct Board and Port under the Tools menu.
Click Upload.
How It Works
Obstacle Detection
Ultrasonic sensors measure distances to obstacles in the front, left, and right directions.
Decision Making
If an obstacle is detected in front, the robot stops, moves backward, and chooses a new direction.
It turns left or right based on the available space.
Movement
Motor control pins enable forward, backward, and turning motions.
Future Enhancements
Advanced Algorithms: Implement A* or other pathfinding algorithms for more efficient maze solving.
Camera Integration: Add computer vision capabilities for visual obstacle detection.
IoT Connectivity: Enable remote monitoring and control via IoT platforms.
Battery Optimization: Enhance power management for longer operation times.
